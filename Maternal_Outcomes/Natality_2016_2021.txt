Caveats:
"1. 'Suppressed' appears when the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality-expanded.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"2. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"3. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 100,000 persons or more. Within each state, data for all"
"counties with fewer than 100,000 persons are combined together under the label ""Unidentified Counties."""
"4. Beginning in 2017, due to state statutory restrictions, California no longer provides record-level data on the marital status"
"of the mother for births occurring in California to California residents and non-residents (including residents of other"
"states). For these births, ""Marital Status"" is coded as ""Not Reported""."
"5. Beginning in 2017, due to state statutory restrictions, California no longer provides record-level data on paternity"
"acknowledgment for births occurring in California to California residents and non-residents (including residents of other"
"states). For these births, ""Paternity Acknowledgment"" is coded as ""Not Reported""."
"6. WIC field Indicates whether the mother received WIC (Women, Infants & Children) food for herself because she was pregnant"
"with this child."
"7. Beginning in 2018 the fields ""Number of Cigarettes 3rd Trimester Recode"" and ""Number of Cigarettes 3rd Trimester"" were"
"recoded to the ""Unknown or Not Stated"" category if the pregnancy didn't last into the 3rd trimester. Thus there is a"
"discontinuity between 2017 and 2018 for all categories of ""Number of Cigarettes 3rd Trimester Recode"" and ""Number of"
"Cigarettes 3rd Trimester""."
